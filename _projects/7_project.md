In my second year, I was a part of a newly-founded society at the University of Edinburgh dealing with humanoid robots. I was responsible for mentoring a team working on an exoskeleton for force amplification. I also hosted a series of workshops on Onshape and Webots and outreach events, collaborated on preparing the society budget and created several resource lists. Within our first year, our society grew to 50-60 members with backgrounds from engineering/CS to biology, graphic design and philosophy who now feel comfortable and confident in the field of robotics.

An example of my output is the CAD portion of a tutorial series we prepared for use in the club, meant as an introduction to people who have no previous CAD experience:

I've also done a series of live presentations on Webots, managed the budget of the society in terms of tools and equipment, and assisted whenever anybody from the other team had questions on ML/RL, PyBullet or anything else.

Robotics is a field requiring a lot of different know-how in many disciplines. To keep the society's knowledge organised, I also created and managed club-wide resource lists on learning Python, PyBullet, Onshape, Git, 3D printing and safe handling of Li-Po batteries, as well as an exoskeleton-specific knowledge base.
