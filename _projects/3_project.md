Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

I love model kits, especially ones of giant robots, but most of them don't quite scratch the mechanical-monstrosity itch for me. I had some free time over this summer in between reseach, so I cooked up this guy:
[pics go here]
For references, I used the inner frame of the walking Gundam in Yokohama, the robots from Virus (1999) and a bunch of brutalist buildings from my home city.
It's nearly all M2x8 screws with the exception of the shoulder joint, which is M3 for just a bit more holding power. For some ungodly reason I also made it parametric - you can adjust its scale, clearance (for where parts fit together) and screw holes, so you can make it as big/small as you want or adjust it to fit your 3D-printer's specs.

Here is it printed on an Ultimaker 3 in my local makerspace. Loose belts and underextrusion aside, it's quite fun and surprisingly durable (it survived, like, 4 falls in the last month). I'd love to print it in SLA to see it in its full glory and check if the joints would still hold up.
