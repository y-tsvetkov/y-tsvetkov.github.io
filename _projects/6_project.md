I love model kits, especially ones of giant robots. I had some free time over this summer in between reseach, so I cooked up this guy in Fusion 360 and rendered it in Keyshot (open images in a new tab for HD):
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/obelisk_front.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/obelisk_back.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/obelisk_irl.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

The renders were a reference for getting it painted eventually. For design references, I used the inner frame of the walking Gundam in Yokohama, the robots from Virus (1999) and a bunch of brutalist buildings from my home city.
It's nearly all M2x8 screws with the exception of the shoulder joint, which is M3 for just a bit more holding power. It's also parametric - you can adjust its scale, clearance (for where parts fit together) and screw holes, so you can make it as big/small as you want or adjust it to fit your 3D-printer's specs.

It was printed on an Ultimaker 3 in my local makerspace. Loose belts and underextrusion aside, it's quite fun and surprisingly durable (it survived, about 4-5 falls in the last month, with the exception of the antenna). I'd love to print it in SLA to see if the joints would still hold up.
