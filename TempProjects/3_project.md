## Inspiration
The Edinburgh Futures Institute tasked our team at Konpanion to prepare a human-robot performance. My role was to prepare the design of the tentacles according to the requirements of the design team. We were given a budget of £5000 to prepare everything, with a budget of £1000 having been assigned for the robot itself. 


## The requirements
As we

We were also constrained by the fact we could use a single 3D printer in terms 

## The idea
I began with checking out how does the average animatronic tentacle work online. The majority of them were made using some sort of cable guides (laser-cut or 3D printed) strung of a stiff bicycle brake cable. These designs, although working well for individual, short-range tentacles, they won't do for our situation. The design folks also really didn't like that, if covered by a latex 'sock', the tentacle would resemble a robot from the 50s rather than a surreal organic life form. 

Considering all that, I had to look for an alternative. Surely there is a sort of extruded, flexible cylinder with a hole, that's widely sold? It just feels like something I've seen before...

I found my answer on my lunch break - there was some construction work going, and on their scaffolding they had some padding that was exactly the thing that I was looking for.

## Did it work?
After a night of sleeping on the floor under the tentacle ( the pool noodles turned out to be really good at keeping the heat around me), we got the tentacle going.

## What's next
If I had more time/budget, I would've changed the fishing line cables for steel ones, and probably use a DC motor + encoder combo instead of servos, as unlimited rotation would allow for a small-diameter winch
