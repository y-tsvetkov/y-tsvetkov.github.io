Hi there - thanks for stopping by.

I am Yordan, a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Edinburgh, as well as a researcher at the [Robust Autonomy and Decisions Group](https://rad.inf.ed.ac.uk/).

My research output is currently centered around achieving more with less in the field of legged robotics. In my first research project (2019-2020), I developed a quadruped robot capable of rough-terrain walking using neural networks with 8-12 neurons. In my [most recent publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08765) at [IROS 2022](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/IROS22/program/IROS22_ContentListWeb_2.html#mob-4_02), I presented a design for a four-legged robot capable of manipulation with 1 or 2 limbs while costing 5 times less than a conventional arm while minimally impacting its moment of inertia.

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV_Yordan_Tsvetkov.pdf) and in the CV tab.

Aside from robotics, I enjoy running, scale modelling, animation and playing the guitar, albeit poorly.
