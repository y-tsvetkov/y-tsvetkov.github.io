## HumanED Robotics Society
Last year, I was a part of a newly-founded society at the University of Edinburgh dealing with humanoid robots. I was responsible for mentoring a team working on an exoskeleton for force amplification. I also hosted a series of workshops on Onshape and Webots and outreach events, collaborated on preparing the society budget and created several resource lists to get new members up to speed with Python, PyBullet, Onshape, Git, 3D printing and safe handling of Li-Po batteries. Within our first year, our society grew to 50-60 members with backgrounds from engineering/CS to biology, graphic design and philosophy who now feel comfortable and confident in the field of robotics.

An example of my output is the CAD portion of a tutorial series we prepared for use in the club, meant as an introduction to people who have no previous CAD experience:
